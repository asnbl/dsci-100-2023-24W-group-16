    "\n",
    "In the medical industry, the ability to efficiently and effectively detect and remedy diseases is crucial to improving a patient's health. Quite notably, the early detection of diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide, can prevent serious complications. Luckily, with advancements in data science we can create models to help predict whether a person has diabetes or not by employing the methods of classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to answer the question: Can we determine key identifiers to whether an adult female of Pima Indian heritage has diabetes, and whether using these specific identifiers produces a better model for prediction of diabetes in an adult female of Pima Indian heritage than using all the given predictors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an existing data set from The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, we will create a classification model to determine the answer to our question. All patients listed in this database are females over the age of 21 and of Pima Indian heritage. This data set consists of several medical predictors (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. They have modeled the outcome on two class variables 0 (does not have diabetes) and 1 (has diabetes).\n"

The data is already tidy, so to make the data easier for the average consumer to interpret, we decided to rename 'Outcome' to 'Diabetes' and refactor its values as \"yes\" and \"no\", rather than 1 and 0, respectively. After that, we then replaced all 0 values which are not in pregnancies with NA as those 0 values are representative of a lack of a measurement.\n",

    "6. We discovered that glucose, insulin, and BMI appear to have the least overlap and therefore are the most different between classes. Using these specific predictors we will make a knn classification model and then compare it with a knn classification model made using all the given predictors.\n",
    "7. For each knn classification model, we first combined pre-processing and model training using a workflow. Then by tuning and using cross-validation, we determined the optimal k-value to use for our classifier. \n",
    "8. Finally, we can test each model’s accuracy on the test data that the classifier was not trained on and compare the results."

    "### Summary of the results found:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we were indeed able to determine key identifiers to whether an adult female of Pima Indian heritage has diabetes using box plots. Then, after building the models and evaluating their performances, we found that the model trained with glucose and insulin gave an accuracy of 73.7% while the model trained with all the predictors gave an accuracy of 70.9%. Thus, it can be said that we were able to produce a better classification model for prediction of diabetes in an adult female of Pima Indian heritage when trained on just the key identifiers(Glucose and Insulin) rather than all of the possible predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected results:\n",
    "\n",
    "The results that we found were the same as what we expected to find. As glucose and insulin were the two predictors that produced box plots of which had the least overlap when plotted against presence of diabetes, we came to a conclusion that a model using glucose and insulin as predictors will most likely produce the best results. This was then verified by our evaluation of both models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Impacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "A model like this can not only contribute to the growing field of predictive medicine but also enhance the concept of preventive healthcare practices which can help improve the lives of millions who are susceptible to diabetes. Timely intervention and adjustments to their lifestyle can aid in managing the condition and lowering the disease's risk. Although our model is not extremely accurate, it is a good start to helping identify individuals at high risk. If a sufficient model is made, we can then examine the efficiency of various intervention approaches, such as dietary and exercise programs, to determine which ones are the most effective in preventing diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Questions:\n",
    "To conclude, while we were able to produce a model which predicts the presence of diabetes in an adult female of Pima Indian heritage, it is not the most accurate, with the better model having an accuracy of **SMT**. Thus, we can ask: \"how we can better our model?\". There are many potential reasons for the inaccuracies in our model, one of which being the uneven distribution of those with and without diabetes in our original data set(65% without, 35% with). A future question that can be asked would be \"Can upsampling help improve the accuracy of our model?\" or \"Will a differently proportioned data set yield the same results?\".\n"
