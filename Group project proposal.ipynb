    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the medical industry, the ability to predict and prevent diseases plays a crucial role in improving any patients' health. By looking at the patterns from the past we can be prepared to take any necessary action to insure that a patient can recover well from a disease and what precautions they should take in the future in order to remain healthy. One such critical area is early detection of diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide. Luckily, with advancements in data science we can easily predict whether a person has diabetes or not by employing the methods of classification. A model like this will not only contribute to the growing field of predictive medicine but also enhance the concept of preventive healthcare practices which can help improve the  lives of millions who are susceptible to diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this existing data set, we will create a classification model to predict if an adult female of Pima Indian heritage has diabetes by looking at the factors:\n",
    "1.Glucose Levels\n",
    "2.Insulin\n",
    "3.Blood Pressure \n",
    "4.BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used is taken from The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. All the patients listed in this database are females over the age of 21 and of Pima Indian heritage. This data set consists of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. They have modeled the outcome on two class variables  0 (does not have diabetes) and 1 (has diabetes). \n"
